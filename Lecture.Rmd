Hyperparameter vs. Parameter

Hyperparameter is something the users can control of.
Parameter is estimated by the model. Think about the betas in regression model, we put a dataset in and the model estimated the betas based on the dataset.

When to use PCA vs. Clustering:
* PCA - feature reduction
* Clustering - multidimensional 

When dealing with distance, we always scale.

kmeans is used for continuous data.
